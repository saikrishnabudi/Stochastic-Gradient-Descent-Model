# Stochastic-Gradient-Descent-Model

Stochastic Gradient Descent Model for Neural Networks

Here, we gave the Batch Size is "1" for the Stochastic Gradient Descent Model.

Here can able to see that there is a huge fall in accuracy for both Training and Testing.

When Compared to the Batch Gradient Descent Model â–¶ ("https://github.com/saikrishnabudi/Batch-Gradient-Descent-Model") Stochastic Gradient Descent Model gives the low accuracy.
